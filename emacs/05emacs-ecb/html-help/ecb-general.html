Normal hook run at the end of activating the ecb-package by running
<code>ecb-activate</code>. This hooks are run after all the internal setup
process but directly before(!) drawing the layout specified in
<code>ecb-layout</code> (means before dividing the frame into several
windows).

<p>A senseful using of this hook can be maximizing the Emacs-frame for
example, because this should be done before the layout is drawn
because ECB computes the size of the ECB-windows with the current
frame size! If you need a hook-option for the real end of the
activating process (i.e. after the layout-drawing) look at
<code>ecb-activate-hook</code>.

<p>IMPORTANT: The difference between this hook and
<code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code> is that the latter one is
evaluated always before the layout is redrawn (for example after
calling <code>ecb-redraw-layout</code>) whereas the former one (this hook)
is only evaluated exactly once during the activation-process of ECB. 
So during the activation process there is the following sequence of
hooks:
<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li><code>ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook</code> \(this one)
<li><code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code>
<li>&lt;Drawing the layout&gt;

<p>See documentation of <code>ecb-current-buffer-sync</code> for conditions when

<p>Precondition for such a hook:
Current buffer is the buffer of the current selected edit-window.

<p>Postcondition for such a hook:
Point must stay in the same edit-window as before evaluating the hook.

<p>Important note: If <code>ecb-window-sync</code> is not nil
<code>ecb-current-buffer-sync</code> is running either every time Emacs is
idle or even after every command (see <code>ecb-window-sync-delay</code>). 
So these hooks can be really called very often! Therefore each
function of this hook should/must check in an efficient way at
beginning if its task have to be really performed and then do them
only if really necessary! Otherwise performance of Emacs could slow
down dramatically!

<p>It is strongly recommended that each function added to this hook uses
the macro <code>ecb-do-if-buffer-visible-in-ecb-frame</code> at beginning! 
See <code>ecb-speedbar-current-buffer-sync</code> and
<code>ecb-eshell-current-buffer-sync</code> for examples how to use this

Specifies all keybindings for the ECB minor-mode key-map. The value is
a cons-cell where the car is a common-prefix key for all the

concatenation of the common-prefix-key (see above) and this
keysequence.

<br><dt><code>&lt;function&gt;:</code>
<dd>The function to bind to the key. This can also be a lambda-expression
. 
</dl>

<p>It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x as
first key of your common-prefix-key!

<p>You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

<p>All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the
syntax needed by <code>read-kbd-macro</code> or <code>kbd</code>. This means you
can insert the key in the same manner <kbd>C-h k</kbd> displays keysequences. 
Here is the summary of the syntax:

<p>Text is divided into "words" separated by whitespace. Except for the words
described below, the characters of each word go directly as characters of the
keysequence. The whitespace that separates words is ignored. Whitespace in the
macro must be written explicitly, as in <kbd>C-c SPC</kbd>.

<ul>
<li>The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent
special control characters. The words must be written in uppercase.

<li>A word in angle brackets, e.g., &lt;return&gt;, &lt;down&gt;, &lt;left&gt; or &lt;f1&gt;,
represents a function key. (Note that in the standard configuration,
the function key &lt;return&gt; and the control key RET are synonymous.). 
You can use angle brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they are
not required there.

<li>Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed by
up to six octal digits. This is the only way to represent keys with
codes above ÿ.

<li>One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt), H-
(hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation. For
function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the brackets:
C-&lt;down&gt; = &lt;C-down&gt;. The prefixes may be written in any order: M-C-x =
C-M-x. Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc,
except that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and
optional minus sign: M-123 = M- M-1 M-2 M-3.

<li>The <code>^</code> notation for control characters also works: ^M = C-m.

List of major-modes for which ECB should be activated or shown. Do not
mistake this option with <code>ecb-auto-activate</code>. The latter one is
for activating ECB after Emacs-startup (even without opening a buffer)
and this one is for defining for which major-modes ECB should be
activated if the mode goes active!

<p>The behavior is like follows: If a mode is contained in this option
ECB is activated after activating this mode (if ECB was deactivated
before) or the ECB-windows are shown if ECB was already active but its
windows were hidden. In every case ECB is activated with visible
ECB-windows afterwards!

<p>For every major mode there can be specified an <code>ecb-layout-name</code>:

<ul>
<li><code>default</code>:
The value customized with <code>ecb-layout-name</code> is chosen. 
<li>a string:
ECB is activated with this layout-name. This changes the value of
<code>ecb-layout-name</code> but only for current emacs-session! But the
layout is only changed if ECB was activated, if just the ECB-windows
were shown, the current layout is used! 
</ul>

<p>There are two additional options:

<ul>
<li><code>none</code>:
No major-modes should activate ECB automatically. 
<li>a regexp:
This means all major-modes which are not listed in
<code>ecb-major-modes-deactivate</code> activate ECB except the symbol-name
of <code>major-mode</code> matches this regexp. If this option is set then
the default regexp excludes all Info- and customize-buffers because
this buffers should not change anything in the ECB-activation state. 
</ul>

<p>Any auto. activation is only done if the current-frame is unsplitted
to avoid changing unnecessarily or unintentionally the frame-layout if
the user just jumps between different windows.

List of major-modes for which ECB should be deactivated or hidden. 
Specify if ECB should be deactivated or at least hidden if a

<ul>
<li><code>hide</code>:
ECB just hides all the ECB windows like with <code>ecb-hide-ecb-windows</code>. 
<li><code>deactivate</code>:
ECB is completely deactivated after activating the major-mode. 
</ul>

<p>There are two additional options:

<ul>
<li><code>none</code>:
No major-modes should deactivate/hide ECB automatically.

<li>A cons for the meaning "All except the activated modes of

<ul>
<li><code>hide-all-except-activated</code>:

<li><code>deactivate-all-except-activated</code>:
All major-modes which are not listed in
<code>ecb-major-modes-activate</code> deactivate ECB.

<p>The cdr of this cons is a regexp: This means all major-modes which are
not listed in <code>ecb-major-modes-activate</code> deactivate/hide ECB
except the symbol-name of <code>major-mode</code> matches this regexp. If
this option is set then the default regexp excludes all Info- and
customize-buffers because this buffers should not change anything in
the ECB-activation state. 
</ul>

<p>If a major-mode is listed in <code>ecb-major-modes-activate</code> as well
as in <code>ecb-major-modes-deactivate</code> then ECB is activated!

<p>Any auto. deactivation/hiding is only done if the edit-window of ECB
is unsplitted and point is in the edit-window to avoid changing
unnecessarily or unintentionally the frame-layout if the user just
jumps between different edit-windows, the tree-windows and the
compile-window of ECB.

<p>There is one exception from this rule: If the edit-window is splitted
and one window contains a dired-buffer and a "ECB-deactivating"-file
is opened via dired then opening this file deactivates ECB (rsp. 
hides the ECB-windows).

<tr><td>
Scroll step for easy hor. scrolling via mouse-click in tree-buffers. 
XEmacs has horizontal scroll-bars so invisible parts beyond the right
window-border of a tree-buffer can always made visible very easy.

<p>GNU Emacs does not have hor. scroll-bars so especially with the mouse
it is quite impossible to scroll smoothly right and left. The
functions <code>scroll-left</code> and <code>scroll-right</code> can be annoying
and are also not bound to mouse-buttons.

<p>If this option is a positive integer S then in all ECB-tree-buffers
the keys <kbd>M-mouse-1</kbd> and <code>M-mouse-3</code> are bound to scrolling
left rsp. right with scroll-step S - clicking with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> or
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> onto the edge of the modeline has the same effect, i.e. 
if you click with mouse-1 onto the left (rsp right) edge of the
modeline you will scroll left (rsp. right).

<p>Additionally <code>C-M-mouse-1</code> and <code>C-M-mouse-3</code> are bound to
scrolling left rsp. right with scroll-step <code>window-width</code> - 2.

<p>Default is a scroll-step of 5. If the value is <code>nil</code> then no keys
for horizontal scrolling are bound.

If node is expanded then it will be collapsed otherwise point jumps to
the next "higher" node in the hierarchical tree (higher means the next
higher tree-level or - if no higher level available - the next higher

If node is not expanded then it will be expanded. Onto a not
expandable node the horizontal arrow-keys go one character in the
senseful correct direction.

belongs NOT to this list.

<p>But in every case the synchronization takes only place if the

directories. Examples for the former one are all
programming-language-modes, <code>Info-mode</code> too, an example for the
latter one is <code>dired-mode</code>. For all major-modes related to
non-file/directory-buffers like <code>help-mode</code>,
<code>customize-mode</code> and others never an autom. synchronization will
be done!

<p>It's recommended to exclude at least <code>Info-mode</code> because it makes
no sense to synchronize the ECB-windows after calling the Info help. 
Per default also <code>dired-mode</code> is excluded but it can also making
sense to synchronize the ECB-directories/sources windows with the
current directory in the dired-buffer.

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Every time the synchronization is done the hook
<code>ecb-current-buffer-sync-hook</code> is evaluated.
